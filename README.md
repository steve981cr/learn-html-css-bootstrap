# Overview
This repository shows how to build a blog website using just HTML and CSS. It mimicks the Bootstrap front-end framework's styling using the same class names (with some exceptions for the grid section). You code the CSS by hand then view it using actual Bootstrap. This allows you to learn CSS and Bootstrap simulaneously. The app mostly follows the styling of the Bootstrap blog page example https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/blog

# Video tutorials
This repository goes with a ten part series of Video tutorials https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc_Hd5ZLCxMGs5j_OinLYUPMQrnsQ7C7N. 
Each part has a starting and ending version of the main pages.

# Accompanying CheatSheet and Flashcards
There is an accompanying  HTML/CSS CheatSheet and FlashCards set available for the CheatSheet & FlashCards desktop application. It is both a reference and memorization tool. The app allows you to download existing CheatSheet & Flashcard modules such as this one. Each module is completely editable so you can add your own flashcards or modify it in any way that's helpful to you, adding your favorite code snippets for future reference. You can create your own CheatSheets as well for any topic. It costs $25. You can decide if the time you save with such a tool is worth it (I personally use it every day).

## Launch the app locally with VS Code and Live Server
To view the different versions with VS Code and Live Server: 
* Make sure to open each version of the blog-site as a separate VS Code project, otherwise the project root will be two levels too high. 
* Right click on the index.html page > select Open With Live Server.
* It will open the page in your default browser to http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html
